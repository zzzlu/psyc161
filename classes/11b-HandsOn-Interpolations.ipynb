      "As you know, BOLD volumes are acquired slice by slice.  E.g. with a TR of 1sec and e.g. 20 slices, last slice would be acquired 19/20th of the second later (assuming no even temporal separation between slices etc).  Many toolkits/groups perform \"slice timing\" correction operation in hope to regain better temporal specificity before performing e.g. spatial smoothing and any further analysis. In its core, basic \"slice timing\" correction is just an interpolation in time between volumes on a voxel-by-voxel basis.\n",
